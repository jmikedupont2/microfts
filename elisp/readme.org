#+TITLE:ORG-FTS, a full-text search for org files with optional ivy support
* *Org-fts indexes all the org files you open and/or save so you can find things later when you're not sure where they are*
* WARNING: This is pre-release code...
I appreciate people trying this out and sending feedback to me via issues on [[https://github.com/zot/microfts][this repository]]!
* Intro
Org-fts is part of the [[https://github.com/zot/microfts][microfts]] project, which it uses for searching
and indexing. Org-fts automatically indexes changed org files as you
visit them and save them. If you delete or rename an org file, org-fts
will lose track of it until you visit it again. It runs microfts
whenever it indexes or searches (every time you hit a key during an
ivy search), so it doesn't need to run a service.

Microfts is fairly fast, (returning results in less than 10ms for
around 3M of files); each keystroke in the screencast below does a
full text search with microfts.  Full text indexing does take space,
however, so expect the index to take maybe 2-5 times the space of your
files in the current implementation. If it gets too extravagant, I
will see if there are more compact ways to store the index.

* Usage
There are two packages here that each provide two commands:
** org-fts provides =M-x org-fts-search= and =M-x org-fts-find-org-file=
*** *M-x org-fts-search*
Searches through all of the indexed org files and presents the results
as a completion list. It returns org elements (table, paragraph,
headline, etc.) that match all the terms you type. If you prefer to
see every file that contains all of the terms you type (like you would
see in a web search), you can customize org-fts-search-args and add
-file to it. This will show only one line per file.

You can quote terms like in a web search: =this "is a" test=
*** *M-x org-fts-find-org-file*
Lets you pick one of the known org files
** ivy-org-fts provides =M-x ivy-org-fts-search= and =M-x ivy-org-fts-find-org-file=
*** *M-x ivy-org-fts-search*
Starts an incremental search through all of the indexed org files and
presents the results with ivy. It returns org elements (table,
paragraph, headline, etc.) that match terms as you type them. If you
prefer to see every file that contains all of the terms you type (like
you would see in a web search), you can customize
ivy-org-fts-search-args and add -file to it. This will show only one
line per file.

You can quote terms like in a web search: =this "is a" test=
*** *M-x ivy-org-fts-find-org-file*
Lets you pick one of the known org files

* Installing
download [[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zot/microfts/main/elisp/org-fts.el][org-fts.el]] and (optionally) [[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zot/microfts/main/elisp/ivy-org-fts.el][ivy-org-fts.el]] use [[elisp:(call-interactively 'package-install-file)][M-x package-install-file]] to install.
* Details
** Automatic microfts download
If you use org-fts without customizing the org-fts-program variable,
it will automatically download microfts into your emacs configuration
directory.
** Database file
org-fts uses a database file called org-fts.db in your emacs configuration directory. If it gets too big, you can use the microfts command to delete entries. You can also just delete the database file and org-fts will automatically create a new one the next time you visit or save an org file.

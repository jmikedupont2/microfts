#+TITLE:ORG-FTS, a full-text search for org files with optional ivy support
* WARNING: This is pre-release code...
I appreciate people trying this out and sending feedback to me via issues on [[https://github.com/zot/microfts][this repository]]!
* Intro
Org-fts automatically indexes changed org files as you visit them and save them. If you delete or rename an org file, org-fts will lose track of it until you visit it again.

Searching is based on microfts, which is fairly fast, (returning results in less than 10ms for around 3M of files). Full text indexing takes space, so expect the index to take maybe 2-5 times the space of your files. Each keystroke in the screencast below does another full text search with microfts.

* Usage
This package provides two commands: =M-x org-fts/search= and =M-x org-fts/find-org-file=
** *M-x org-fts/search*
Searches through all of the indexed org files and presents the results as a completion list. It returns org elements (table, paragraph, headline, etc.) that match all the terms you type. If you prefer to see every file that contains all of the terms you type (like you would see in a web search), you can customize org-fts/search-args and add -file to it. This will show only one line per file.

You can quote terms like in a web search: =this "is a" test=
** *M-x org-fts/find-org-file*
Lets you pick one of the known org files
** *M-x ivy-org-fts/search*
Starts an incremental search through all of the indexed org files and presents the results with ivy. It returns org elements (table, paragraph, headline, etc.) that match terms as you type them. If you prefer to see every file that contains all of the terms you type (like you would see in a web search), you can customize org-fts/search-args and add -file to it. This will show only one line per file.

You can quote terms like in a web search: =this "is a" test=
** *M-x ivy-org-fts/find-org-file*
Lets you pick one of the known org files
